# Pytorch Implementation of Pruning Methods about Thinet,LASSO,maxout and random  
Thinet(option : greedy) paper : ThiNet: A Filter Level Pruning Method for Deep Neural Network Compression(ICCV,2017)

LASSO(option : lasso) paper: Channel Pruning for Accelerating Very Deep Neural Networks(ICCV,2017)

maxout : channel pruning with small norm channels

random : channel pruning using layer-wise random selection

# Requirements
python 3.7

pytorch 1.4

# prune on cifar-100

# VGG16_BN weights and Resnet-18 weights

have to download model weights
